<h1>OTP Scam Awareness</h1>

<p>
OTP scams occur when fraudsters trick users into sharing one-time passwords
used for secure verification.

<h2>How OTP Scams Happen</h2>

Scammers pretend to be bank officials or customer support agents.
</p>

<h2>Golden Rule</h2>
<p>
No company, bank, or government office will ever ask for your OTP.
</p>

<h2>Kavalkaran Mission</h2>
<p>
Kavalkaran spreads OTP awareness to protect common people.
